Tsugumi will soon be rescued. The game is cleared once she's saved.[r]
Just one more step to go.[pcms]

I was preparing to storm in, my emotions heightened as if I was facing[r]
the final stage of a game.[pcms]

"It's a simple floor plan to the classroom where Tsugumi-chan is.[r]
Though I doubt you'll get lost."[pcms]

Shizuka-chan handed me a torn piece of notebook paper with a smile.[pcms]

"With this, it's perfect. Thanks, Shizuka-chan."[pcms]


*7162|
[fc]
At a glance, I could easily understand the route. This kind of[r]
thoughtfulness is so typical of Shizuka-chan. Tsugumi, on the other[r]
hand, would probably have just vaguely described it.[pcms]


*7163|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"Alright, perfect. It's about time to go! Thanks for this helmet too![r]
How about it? Do I look like a cleanup hitter from a famous baseball[r]
team?"[pcms]

"Hehe, anyone can be a cleanup hitter if they hold a bat, right? That[r]
helmet doesn't fit you. It's floating because it's not worn properly."[pcms]

Honma-sensei offered me a steaming cup of coffee while laughing.[pcms]


*7166|
[fc]
The sweet smell of coffee and milk gently wafted up, tickling my nose.[pcms]


*7167|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"Eh...? Ah, I just placed it on top."[pcms]


*7168|

I looked at the helmet perched on my head as Honma-sensei and Shizuka-[r]
chan chuckled.[pcms]

[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"..."[pcms]


*7170|
[fc]
I tried to look cool, but ended up being laughed at. Embarrassed, I[r]
forcefully pulled the helmet down over my head and pretended to[r]
casually chug down the coffee I received.[pcms]


*7171|
[fc]
But I was surprised by the pleasant smell tickling my nostrils and the[r]
texture of the coffee as soon as it touched my tongue, and I stopped[r]
moving.[pcms]

properly, it would have been perfect."[pcms]

In my excitement, I hadn't noticed, but just as Honma-sensei said, I[r]
could faintly hear the voices of the infected.[pcms]

I checked once more to make sure the helmet was on properly before[r]
gripping the bat again.[pcms]

I slightly opened the blinds at the entrance of the lodge to check[r]
outside, where I could see the infected wandering around.[pcms]


*7185|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"So, after making a cool entrance... These infected bastards are more[r]
troublesome than I thought... But I can't afford to be scared now!!"[pcms]


*7186|
[fc]
Yes. There are fewer of them now than when they gathered after I[r]
shouted at Tsugumi earlier.[pcms]


*7187|
[fc]
If I'm going to go, now's the only chance![pcms]


*7188|

[ns]Katsumi[nse]
"Let's go, hero Kazumi! My batting average is .350! Take that, you[r]
infected bastards!!"[pcms]


*7189|
[fc]
But... before that.[pcms]


*7190|
[fc]
I looked over the simplified map Shizuka-chan gave me and confirmed[r]
the route.[pcms]


*7191|
[fc]
The note Shizuka-chan wrote says to enter through the door with the[r]
emergency stairs.[pcms]


*7192|
[fc]
But right in front of me is a window to a first-floor classroom. It[r]
might also be possible to enter through there.[pcms]


*7193|
[fc]
The proper way would be to follow Shizuka-chan's note and use the[r]
emergency stairs.[pcms]


*7194|
[fc]
If I take the emergency stairs straight up to the second floor, that[r]
should do it.[pcms]


*7195|
[fc]
But-- what if not only the first-floor entrance but also the second-[r]
floor entrance is locked?[pcms]


*7196|
[fc]
The other plan I have might increase the chances of being surrounded[r]
by the infected. But once I'm inside, I'll be in control. It's[r]
unlikely that the doors will be closed.[pcms]
