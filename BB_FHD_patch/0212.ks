On public airwaves, and moreover on a national broadcasta medium that[r]
one would normally watch with a sense of securityimages that should[r]
not exist were being shown.[pcms]


*1124|

Because of that, I was like a pigeon that had been shot with a pellet[r]
gun, my eyes wide open, unable to move my face away from the TV screen[r]

turned it off and looked outside the window.[pcms]

*1154|
[fc]
I held my breath--[pcms]


*1155|
[fc]
Trying not to make any noise, I pulled my head back into the room,[r]
quietly closed the window, locked the window and the front door before[r]
finally opening my mouth.[pcms]


*1156|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"Phewww!! ...What...is that?"[pcms]


*1157|
[fc]
Apparently, what's on TV isn't just some special program. The noisy[r]
crowd outside doesn't seem to be having a festival either.[pcms]


*1158|
[fc]
So is it really a riot?[pcms]


*1159|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"No no no no!!"[pcms]


*1160|
[fc]
It's too early to conclude.[pcms]


*1161|
[fc]
Let's take another look at the TV. There's no need to rush to[r]
conclusions.[pcms]


*1162|
[fc]
In an effort to regain my composure, I sit down and look around the[r]
room for some coffee milk to drink.[pcms]


*1163|
[fc]
That's when I notice the terrible state of the room.[pcms]


*1164|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"...Gross..."[pcms]


*1165|
[fc]
The coffee milk I had inadvertently spit out while watching TV earlier[r]
had spread all over the floor.[pcms]


*1166|
[fc]
Seeing the mess I've made, my heart, which had been pounding wildly,[r]
and my agitated feelings gradually begin to calm down.[pcms]


*1167|
[fc]
Even though it was my own doing, it feels somewhat pathetic.[pcms]


*1168|
[fc]
But if I don't clean it up properly, with this heat, things could get[r]
really bad.[pcms]


*1169|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"Tissues, tissues... Ah, this is disgusting. Maybe I should clean up[r]
while I'm at it..."[pcms]


*1170|
[fc]
As I distance myself from the commotion and stare at the light brown[r]
liquid splattered on the ground, a sense of sadness washes over me.[pcms]


*1171|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"Ah, maybe I should just join in that festival-like chaos. There was[r]
even a chick flashing her tits. It looked fun. ...But if I joined in,[r]
it definitely wouldn't be interesting!"[pcms]


*1172|
[fc]
That's right, what the hell is up with those people! It makes no[r]
sense![pcms]


*1173|
[fc]
I'd like to say this is a time for TV... but after what happened[r]
earlier...[pcms]


*1174|
[fc]
Still, I don't have any other source of information, and maybe, just[r]
maybe, "that" itself was a dream I had.[pcms]


*1175|
[fc]
Hmm, why is this happening? Hmm...[pcms]


*1176|
[fc]
...[pcms]


*1177|
[fc]
Caught up in an incomprehensible situation, I can't settle the chaos[r]
in my mind, and my irritation only grows.[pcms]


*1178|
[fc]
No matter how much I think about it, there's no way an answer will[r]
come. After all, if there were an answer, there'd be no need to worry![pcms]


*1179|
[fc]
[ns]Kazumi[nse]
"Ah, screw it! It makes no sense! Fine then, even if it's some weird[r]
special program! TV, TV!"[pcms]

In a fit of anger, I forcefully press the remote control button and[r]
turn the TV back on.[pcms]

While pulling out the baseball equipment stored in the closet, I raise[r]
my voice to motivate myself.[pcms]

The uniform, bat, shoes, glove. Everything shines as if it had been[r]
waiting for this moment.[pcms]

I didn't maintain them for this kind of situation. But if not now,[r]
then when?[pcms]
